Born in Miami, FL as a first generation immigrant. I was taught from a young age to always excel
and live my life to set the world on fire. I am currently a senior at Allegheny College pursuing
my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science while also getting a minor in Economics. After college I
have accepted a position to work with LSP Cargo Incorporated to work with international business
who wish to have their cargo delivered or stored for inventory at a warehouse location. I plan to 
work here until I have saved enough money to go to grad school for either cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Analytics.
